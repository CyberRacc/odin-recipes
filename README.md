Welcome to Odin Recipes!

This repository is home to an early website of mine as I am following The Odin Project.

This is a very basic recipes website, it doesn't look pretty, but it does what it is supposed to.

I have no idea what I am doing to be honest but I'm doing things.

It contains recipes for Pease Pudding, Pepperoni Pizza and Lasagna.

I've done HTML in the past at university, but nothing complex, so it's been nice to refresh my memory on all this.

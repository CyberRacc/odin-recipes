            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Pease pudding is one of those rare foods outside of north-east England, which is unfortunate if you're like me and used
                to it growing up, now you've moved away and can't find it anywhere. So you decide to look up a recipe to make it 
                 only to find there's no <em>real</em> recipes for it, adding unecessary ingredients and such.
            </p>

            <p>You may be happy to know that it's as simple as <em>shove it in the pan and leave it</em>. Which is a great 
                thing, and it doesn't need many ingredients at all; take a look.
            </p>

    

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Yellow split peas</li>
                <li>Whole onion, usually brown.</li>
                <li>Water</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Yes, that's really all there is to it. Now onto the method.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Set 750ml of water to boil in a pan.</li>
                <li>Add 250g of yellow split peas.</li>
                <li>Cut the top and botton from the onion, peel it, and add it to the water whole.</li>
                <li>Set to a medium heat, on an induction I would go with 4.</li>
        
            </ol>

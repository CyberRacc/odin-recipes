    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pepperoni Pizza is a simple thing to make but probably one of the most popular foods in the world.
         It's something everyone has had, and it has a massive variety of toppings, but for this recipe we will
          focus on a simple pepperoni pizza.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>Not many ingredients are required, but the dough can be a chore, I recommend ready-made dough from the shop.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>Mozarella cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato pureé</li>
        <li>Pepperoni slices</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper</li>
        <li>Basil if you like</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Roll your dough into a pizza base and stab with fork several times.</li>
        <li>Spread tomato puree over the base. Add chopped tomatoes on top then add onion and garlic.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle over cheese and arrange Pepperoni. Season with salt and pepper and optionally sprinkle on some basil.</li>
        <li>Place pizza on oiled baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Add toppings.</li>
        <li>Cook at 200°C for 20mins.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That's really it, it's a pretty simple recipe but it makes for a beautiful meal and will save you money
        not ordering another pizza.
